# Stakeholder Transactions System Implementation

## Overview
This implementation creates a bidirectional relationship between the Stakeholders and Accounts systems, allowing for tracking of financial transactions and activities associated with stakeholders. Changes made in one system automatically reflect in the other.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema (sql/stakeholder_transactions.sql)
- Added `stakeholder_id` column to the `accounts` table with foreign key reference to `stakeholders`
- Created `stakeholder_transactions` view for easier querying of account transactions with stakeholder information
- Added `get_stakeholder_transaction_summary()` function to calculate transaction statistics per stakeholder
- Created trigger `sync_stakeholder_activity` to update stakeholder's `updated_at` when transactions are added/modified
- Added appropriate indexes for performance optimization

### 2. Type Definitions (src/lib/types/schemas.ts)
- Updated `Account` interface to include:
  - `stakeholder_id?: number | null` - Reference to associated stakeholder
  - `stakeholder?` - Joined stakeholder data (id, name, address, is_completed)
- Updated `Stakeholder` interface to include:
  - `transactions?: Account[]` - Array of financial transactions for this stakeholder

### 3. Accounts Hook (src/hooks/useAccounts.tsx)
Updated `AccountFormData` interface to include `stakeholder_id`

Added new functions:
- `fetchAccountsByStakeholder(stakeholderId: number)` - Fetches all transactions for a specific stakeholder
- `getStakeholderTransactionSummary(stakeholderId: number)` - Returns transaction summary including:
  - Total transactions count
  - Total income
  - Total expense
  - Net amount
  - Pending transactions count
  - Completed transactions count

Updated existing functions:
- `fetchAccounts()` - Now includes stakeholder data in the query
- `createAccount()` and `updateAccount()` - Support stakeholder_id parameter

### 4. Stakeholders Hook (src/hooks/useStakeholders.tsx)
- Updated `fetchStakeholderById()` to include transactions in the query using `transactions:accounts(*)`

### 5. Accounts Tab Component (src/components/admin-management/tabs/AccountsTab.tsx)
- Added `useStakeholders` hook integration
- Updated form to include stakeholder selection dropdown
- Added stakeholder column to the accounts table
- Form now displays stakeholders with their status (Active/Completed)
- Both create and edit modals support stakeholder selection

### 6. Stakeholder Transactions Component (src/components/stakeholders/StakeholderTransactions.tsx)
New component that displays:
- **Summary Cards**: 
  - Total Transactions
  - Total Income
  - Total Expense
  - Net Amount
- **Transaction History Table**: Shows all transactions with:
  - Date
  - Title
  - Payment Method
  - Source
  - Amount (color-coded: green for income, red for expense)
  - Status (Complete/Pending)

### 7. Stakeholder Detail Page (src/app/(home)/admin-management/stakeholders/[id]/page.tsx)
- Added new "Transactions" tab alongside "Process Steps" and "Issues"
- Integrated `StakeholderTransactions` component
- Tab shows complete financial activity for the stakeholder

## How It Works

### Creating a Transaction with a Stakeholder
1. User navigates to Accounts/Transactions page
2. Clicks "Create New Transaction"
3. Fills in transaction details and selects a stakeholder (optional)
4. On save, the transaction is created with the stakeholder_id
5. The stakeholder's updated_at timestamp is automatically updated via database trigger

### Viewing Stakeholder Transactions
1. User navigates to a stakeholder detail page
2. Clicks on the "Transactions" tab
3. Sees summary cards with financial statistics
4. Views complete transaction history table
5. All data is fetched in real-time using the `fetchAccountsByStakeholder` function

### Bidirectional Updates
- **Account → Stakeholder**: When creating/updating an account with a stakeholder_id, the stakeholder's updated_at is automatically updated
- **Stakeholder → Account**: Transactions are displayed in the stakeholder detail page via the transactions array
- Both systems maintain referential integrity through foreign key constraints

## Database Triggers
The `sync_stakeholder_activity` trigger ensures that whenever an account transaction is inserted or updated with a stakeholder_id, the associated stakeholder's `updated_at` timestamp is refreshed. This keeps stakeholder records current and allows for activity-based filtering.

## Benefits
1. **Complete Financial Tracking**: All stakeholder financial activities are tracked in one place
2. **Automatic Synchronization**: Changes in either system automatically reflect in the other
3. **Performance Optimized**: Proper indexing on stakeholder_id ensures fast queries
4. **Summary Statistics**: Quick access to financial summaries without manual calculation
5. **Audit Trail**: Timestamps and relationships maintain complete audit history
6. **Flexible Design**: Stakeholder association is optional - not all transactions need a stakeholder

## Testing Notes
- The Next.js build compiles successfully
- Pre-existing TypeScript errors in unrelated files (tasks page) were not addressed per instructions
- All new code follows the established patterns in the codebase
- Components use existing UI patterns (FormModal, animations, etc.)
