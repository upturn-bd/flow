- `createProcess(data)` - Create new process
- `updateProcess(id, data)` - Update existing process
- `deleteProcess(id)` - Delete process

**Step Management:**
- `fetchProcessSteps(processId)` - Get all steps for a process
- `createProcessStep(data)` - Add new step
- `updateProcessStep(id, data)` - Update step (increments version)

---

## üìã REMAINING WORK

### Phase 5 (Continue):
1. **Create Stakeholder Form** - Form to add new leads
2. **Stakeholder Detail Page** - View and manage individual stakeholder
3. **Dynamic Step Forms** - Forms generated from field_definitions
4. **File Upload** - Integration with Supabase Storage
5. **Backward Compatibility** - Display old field data alongside new

### Phase 6: Permissions & RLS
- Permission entries already created in migration
- RLS policies already created in migration
- Need to update middleware path arrays
- Need to add stakeholder routes to nav-items.ts

### Phase 7: Testing
- Run migration on database
- Test complete workflow end-to-end
- Test sequential vs independent processes
- Test file uploads with size limits
- Test backward compatibility
- Test team-based permissions

---

## üîß DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### Before Running:
1. ‚úÖ Backup existing stakeholder data (if needed)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Run `sql/stakeholder_refactor_migration.sql`
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Update navigation items to include stakeholder routes
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Update middleware paths if needed
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Create at least one team before creating processes
6. ‚ö†Ô∏è Test on staging environment first

### Migration Steps:
```sql
-- 1. Backup (if needed)
-- 2. Run the migration
\i sql/stakeholder_refactor_migration.sql

-- 3. Verify tables created
\dt stakeholder*

-- 4. Verify permissions
SELECT * FROM permissions WHERE module_name LIKE 'stakeholder%';
```

## üìä ARCHITECTURE HIGHLIGHTS

### Process Flow:
```
Process Definition ‚Üí Steps Configuration ‚Üí Stakeholder Creation ‚Üí Step Data Entry ‚Üí Completion
```

### Key Design Decisions:
1. **JSONB for Flexibility** - Field definitions and step data stored as JSONB
2. **Version Tracking** - Steps track versions for backward compatibility
3. **Snapshot Pattern** - Step data stores field definition snapshot
4. **Auto-progression** - Database triggers handle completion and progression
5. **Team-based Access** - RLS policies enforce team permissions per step
6. **Mutable Processes** - Processes can be edited; old data preserved via snapshots

### Permission Model:
- **stakeholder_processes** - Admin permission to manage process definitions
- **stakeholders** - Service permission to manage stakeholder data
- **Step-level access** - Team members can write only their assigned steps
- **Read access** - All users with stakeholder permission can read all data

---

### Phase 5: Stakeholder UI (COMPLETE)

   - Process selection with validation
   - Smart error handling (no processes warning)
   - Contact persons management (multiple contacts)
   - Email/phone validation
   - Auto-assigns to first step on creation

3. **Detail Page** (`[id]/page.tsx`)

   - Contact persons with clickable links
   - Visual step progression tracker
   - "Work on Step" button for current step

### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Create process with sequential steps
- [ ] Create process with independent steps
- [ ] Add dynamic fields (text, boolean, date, file)
- [ ] Create lead without processes (should show error)
- [ ] Create lead with process (should assign to step 1)
- [ ] Complete steps in order (sequential)
- [ ] Complete steps in any order (independent)
- [ ] Verify lead ‚Üí stakeholder conversion
- [ ] Test search and filters
- [ ] Edit process, verify backward compatibility
