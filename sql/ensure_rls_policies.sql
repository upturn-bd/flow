-- ENSURE RLS POLICIES (Recursion Fixed)
-- ==============================================================================
-- This script enforces Row Level Security (RLS) policies for:
-- 1. Core permission tables (teams, permissions, team_permissions, team_members)
-- 2. Content tables (task_records, project_records, etc.) based on permission modules
--
-- CRITICAL FIX: Uses 'get_auth_company_id()' to avoid infinite recursion in RLS policies.
