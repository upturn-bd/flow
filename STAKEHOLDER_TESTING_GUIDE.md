# Stakeholder System - Testing & Deployment Guide

## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

**IMPORTANT: This migration will DROP all existing stakeholder data!**

Make sure you have a backup before proceeding.

```bash
# Connect to your Supabase database
# Option 1: Via Supabase CLI
supabase db reset # If you want to reset everything
# OR
# Option 2: Via psql or Supabase SQL Editor
# Copy and paste the contents of sql/stakeholder_refactor_migration.sql
```

**What the migration does:**
- ‚úÖ Drops old tables: `stakeholder_issues`, `stakeholders`, `stakeholder_types`
- ‚úÖ Adds `file_size_limit_mb` to companies table (default 10MB)
- ‚úÖ Creates 4 new tables: `stakeholder_processes`, `stakeholder_process_steps`, `stakeholders`, `stakeholder_step_data`
- ‚úÖ Creates indexes for performance
- ‚úÖ Sets up RLS policies for team-based access
- ‚úÖ Creates auto-completion trigger
- ‚úÖ Updates team permissions with new modules

### Step 2: Verify Database Schema

Run these queries to verify the migration succeeded:

```sql
-- Check tables exist
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename IN (
  'stakeholder_processes', 
  'stakeholder_process_steps', 
  'stakeholders', 
  'stakeholder_step_data'
);

-- Check permissions are added
SELECT * FROM team_permissions 
WHERE module IN ('stakeholders', 'stakeholder_processes')
LIMIT 5;

-- Check file size limit column
SELECT file_size_limit_mb FROM companies LIMIT 1;
```

### Step 3: Test the System

Follow the testing workflow below to ensure everything works.

5. Verify you can complete steps in any order

**Expected Result:** All steps show "Work on Step" button simultaneously

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations & TODO

### File Uploads
- **Status:** UI exists but backend integration pending
- **What's Needed:**
  1. Set up Supabase Storage bucket for stakeholder files
  2. Implement upload logic in `useStakeholders` hook
  3. Enforce `file_size_limit_mb` from companies table
  4. Generate and store file URLs in step data
  5. Add file download/preview functionality

### Backward Compatibility
- **Status:** Schema supports it via `field_definitions_snapshot`
- **What's Needed:**
  1. UI to show "This field was from an older version" notices
  2. Migration tool for admins to update old data to new schema
  3. Visual diff between current and snapshot definitions

### RLS Policies
- **Status:** Basic policies created in migration
- **What's Needed:**
  1. Test with different team assignments
  2. Verify team members can only edit their assigned steps
  3. Add company_id scoping to all queries in hook

### Notifications
- **Status:** Placeholder in hook (commented out)
- **What's Needed:**
  1. Fix NotificationType errors
  2. Implement notifications for:
     - New lead assigned to team
     - Step completed
     - Lead converted to stakeholder
     - Process changes affecting active leads

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "No stakeholder processes found" even after creating process
**Solution:** Ensure process is marked as "Active" and refresh the page

### Steps not appearing for stakeholder
**Solution:** Check that process has steps configured. Navigate to process detail and add steps.

### "Work on Step" button not appearing
**Solution:** 
- For sequential processes: Previous steps must be completed first
- For independent processes: Check if step is already completed
- Verify user has permission for the assigned team

### File upload shows "File upload integration pending"
**Solution:** This is expected - file upload backend is not yet implemented

### Stakeholder not auto-advancing to next step
**Solution:** Check database trigger `auto_complete_stakeholder` is active:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'auto_complete_stakeholder';
```

---

## üìä Database Queries for Monitoring

### Check active leads vs stakeholders
```sql
SELECT 
  is_completed,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM stakeholders
WHERE company_id = YOUR_COMPANY_ID
GROUP BY is_completed;
```

### View step completion rates
```sql
SELECT 
  sp.name as process_name,
  sps.name as step_name,
  COUNT(ssd.id) as completions
FROM stakeholder_process_steps sps
LEFT JOIN stakeholder_step_data ssd ON ssd.step_id = sps.id
JOIN stakeholder_processes sp ON sp.id = sps.process_id
WHERE sp.company_id = YOUR_COMPANY_ID
GROUP BY sp.name, sps.name
ORDER BY sp.name, sps.step_order;
```

### Find stuck leads (on same step > 30 days)
```sql
SELECT 
  s.name,
  s.created_at,
  sps.name as current_step,
  DATE_PART('day', NOW() - s.created_at) as days_on_step
FROM stakeholders s
JOIN stakeholder_process_steps sps ON sps.id = s.current_step_id
WHERE s.is_completed = FALSE
  AND DATE_PART('day', NOW() - s.created_at) > 30
ORDER BY days_on_step DESC;
```
